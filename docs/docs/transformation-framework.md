# Transformation APIs

The Transformation Framework in Starlasu provides tools and patterns for transforming ASTs from one form to another.

## What are Transformations?

Transformations convert ASTs between different representations:

- **Parse Tree to AST**: Convert low-level parse trees to high-level ASTs
- **Language to Language**: Transform between different programming languages
- **Optimization**: Apply optimizations and simplifications
- **Normalization**: Convert to canonical forms

## Transformation Patterns

Common transformation patterns include:

- **Visitor-based**: Walk the AST and transform each node
- **Rule-based**: Apply transformation rules to matching patterns
- **Template-based**: Use templates for complex transformations
- **Incremental**: Transform only changed portions

## Key Components

- **Transformation Engine**: Orchestrates the transformation process
- **Rule System**: Defines transformation rules and conditions
- **Validation**: Ensures transformations maintain AST integrity
- **Rollback**: Support for undoing transformations

## Benefits

- **Code Migration**: Transform legacy code to modern languages
- **Optimization**: Apply performance improvements automatically
- **Normalization**: Standardize code structures
- **Interoperability**: Enable code sharing between platforms

## Implementation

Starlasu provides:

- **Base Classes**: Common transformation infrastructure
- **Utility Methods**: Helper functions for common operations
- **Testing Support**: Tools for validating transformations
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient transformation algorithms
