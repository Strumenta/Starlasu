# Methods

This section covers the systematic approaches and methodologies developed within the Starlasu framework:

## The Chisel Method

The Chisel Method is a detailed methodology for designing and implementing parsers. It provides a systematic approach to:

- **Parser Design**: Structured approach to parser architecture
- **Implementation Strategy**: Step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Best Practices**: Proven techniques and patterns
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid and how to handle challenges

The Chisel Method represents the distillation of years of experience in parser development, providing a reliable path from concept to working implementation.
